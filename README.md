# Basic trigonometric identities

This is a LaTeX document containing basic trigonometric identities that can be useful for students that are studying Calculus related topics that consist of trigonometry. This is a modified version of the LaTeX trigonometric identities published by Evgenii. My modified version contains:

- Basic trigonometric properties
- Exponential identities and relations to trigonometry
- Euler's identity
- Fourier coefficient and series formulas.

If some things can be improved, formulas/identities are missing or you spot any errors: Please let me know!
